*How to create a sharp mesh from a function without even trying*

In [part 1](//www.boristhebrave.com/2018/04/15/marching-cubes-tutorial/)
and [part
2](//www.boristhebrave.com/2018/04/15/marching-cubes-3d-tutorial/) of
the series, we looked at the Marching Cubes algorithm, and how it can
turn any function into a grid based mesh. In this article we’ll look at
some of the shortcomings and how we can do better.

<span id="more-225"></span>\
Marching Cubes is easy to implement, and therefore ubiquitous. But it
has a number of problems:

1.  Complexity\
    Even though you only need process one cube at a time, Marching Cubes
    ends up pretty complicated as there are a lot of different possible
    cases to consider.
    <figure>
    <img src="//www.boristhebrave.com/content/2018/04/mc_18_cases_small.png"
    decoding="async" />
    </figure>

2.  Ambiguity\
    Some cases in Marching Cubes cannot be obviously resolved one way or
    another. In 2d, if you have two opposing corners, it’s impossible to
    say if they are meant to be joined or not.

    <figure>
    <img src="//www.boristhebrave.com/content/2018/04/mc_ambig.svg"
    decoding="async" alt="Figure 4" />
    </figure>

    In 3d, the problem is even worse, as inconsistent choices can leave
    you with a leaky mesh. We had to write extra code to deal with that
    in [part
    2](//www.boristhebrave.com/2018/04/15/marching-cubes-3d-tutorial/).

3.  Marching Cubes cannot do sharp edges and corners\
    Here’s a square approximated with Marching Cubes.

    <figure>
    <img src="//www.boristhebrave.com/content/2018/04/mc_square.svg"
    decoding="async" alt="Figure 5" />
    </figure>

    The corners have been sliced off. Adaptivity cannot help here –
    Marching Squares always creates straight lines on the interior of
    any cell, which is where the target square corner happens to lie.

So, what do do next?

## Enter Dual Contouring

<div class="alert alert-warning">

**Brevity Alert:** This tutorial covers concepts and ideas more than
methods and code. If you are more interested in the implementation, make
sure you check out the python implementation
([2d ](https://github.com/BorisTheBrave/mc-dc/blob/a165b326849d8814fb03c963ad33a9faf6cc6dea/dual_contour_2d.py),
[3d ](https://github.com/BorisTheBrave/mc-dc/blob/a165b326849d8814fb03c963ad33a9faf6cc6dea/dual_contour_3d.py)),
which contains commented example code with all the nitty gritty.

</div>

Dual Contouring solves these problems, and is more extensible to boot.
The trade off is we need to know even more information about \\ f(x) \\,
the function determining what is solid and what is not. Not only do we
need to know the value of \\ f(x) \\, we also need to know the gradient
\\ f'(x) \\. That extra information will improve the adaptivity from
marching cubes.

Dual Contouring works by placing a single vertex in each cell, and then
“joining the dots” to form the full mesh. Dots are joined across every
edge that has a sign change, just like in marching cubes.

<figure>
<img src="//www.boristhebrave.com/content/2018/04/dc_tee_comparison.svg"
decoding="async" />
</figure>

<div class="alert alert-info">

**Aside:**\
The “dual” in the name comes from the fact that cells in the grid
becomes vertices in the mesh, which relates to the [**dual
graph**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_graph).

</div>

Unlike Marching Cubes, we cannot evaluate cells independently. We must
consider adjacent ones to “join the dots” and find the full mesh. But in
fact, it’s a lot [simpler
algorithm ](https://github.com/BorisTheBrave/mc-dc/blob/a165b326849d8814fb03c963ad33a9faf6cc6dea/dual_contour_3d.py#L57)
than Marching Cubes because there are not a lot of distinct cases. You
simply find every edge with a sign change, and connect the vertices for
the cells adjacent to that edge.

## Gradients

The [**gradient**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient) of a function
f is a measure of how quickly the value of f changes at a given point
when moving in any given direction. It’s normally given as pair of
numbers for every point, indicating how much the function changes when
moving along the x-axis or y-axis.

In marching cubes, we just needed to evaluate the function \\ f \\ on a
grid. Now, we need gradient information, and not just on the grid
points, but at certain points in between as well. While there are a
number of sources of this information, by far the simplest is to start
with a function \\ f \\ that can evaluated in *any* point in space. We
can then calculate the gradient information using calculus, or
numerically. Note that the gradient is often called the normal, or
hermite data, which are similar concepts.

### Getting the gradient

In our simple example of a 2d circle of radius 2.5, \\ f \\ is defined
as:

\\ f(x, y) = 2.5 – \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \\

(in other words, 2.5 minus the distance from the origin)

With a bit of calculus, we can compute the gradient at any given
position:

\\ f'(x, y) = \text{Vec2}\left(\frac{-x}{\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}},
\frac{-y}{\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}} \right) \\

But you don’t need complicated maths to get the gradient function. You
can just measure the change in \\ f \\ when \\ x \\ and \\ y \\ are
perturbed by a small amount \\ d \\.

\\ f'(x, y) \approx \text{Vec2}\left(\frac{f(x+d, y) – f(x-d, y)}{2d},
\frac{f(x, y+d) – f(x, y-d)}{2d} \right) \\

This works for any sufficiently smooth \\ f \\, providing you pick \\ d
\\ small enough. In practice, even functions with sharp points are
sufficiently smooth, as you don’t need evaluate the gradient near the
sharp parts for it to work. [Link to

.

## Adaptivity

So far, we’ve just got the same sort of stepped look that Marching Cubes
had. We need to add some adaptivity. For Marching Cubes, we chose where
along the edge put a vertex. Now we have a free choice of anywhere in
the interior of the cell.

First, we’ll evaluate \\ f \\ at each corner of the cell, and estimate
where the boundary intersects each edge, i.e. the locations that would
be used for vertices of marching cubes.

But instead, we load gradient information for those points. The dual
contouring vertices will be placed at the point inside the cell that is
most consistent with those gradients.

<figure>

</figure>

By picking the illustrated point, we ensure that the output faces from
this cell conform as well as possible to the normals:

<figure>
<img src="//www.boristhebrave.com/content/2018/04/dc_example.svg"
decoding="async" />
</figure>

In practice, not all the normals around the cell are going to agree. We
need to pick the point of best fit. I discuss how to handle picking that
point in a [later section](#picking).

## Going 3d

The 2d and 3d cases aren’t really that different. A cell is now a cube,
not a square. And we are outputting faces, not edges. But that’s it. The
routine for picking a single point per cell is the same. And we still
find edges with a sign change, and then connect the points of adjacent
cells, but now that is 4 cells, giving us a 4-sided polygon:

every adjacent cell.</figcaption>
</figure>

## Results

Dual contouring has a more natural look and flow to it than marching
cubes, as you can see in this sphere constructed with it:

<figure id="render_container">

</figure>

In 3d, this procedure is robust enough to pick points running along the
edge of a sharp feature, and to pick out corners where they occur.

<span id="picking"></span>

## Choosing a vertex location

One major problem I glossed over before is how to choose the point
location when the normals don’t point to a consistent location.

<figure>
<img src="//www.boristhebrave.com/content/2018/04/dc_inconsistent.png"
decoding="async" />
</figure>

The problem is even worse in 3d when there are likely to be a lot of
normals.

The way to solve this is to pick the point that is mutually the best for
all the normals.

First, for each normal, we assign a penalty to locations further away
from ideal. Then we sum up all the penalty functions, which will give an
ellipse shaped penalty. Finally, we pick the point with the lowest
penalty.

<figure>
<img src="//www.boristhebrave.com/content/2018/04/dc_valley.png"
decoding="async" />
</figure>

Mathematically, the individual penalty functions are the square of the
distance from the ideal line for that normal. The sum of all those
squared terms is a [quadratic
function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_function), so the
total penalty function is called the **QEF** (quadratic error function).
Finding the minimal point of a quadratic function is a standard routine
available in most matrix libraries.\
In my [python
implementation](https://github.com/BorisTheBrave/mc-dc/blob/a165b326849d8814fb03c963ad33a9faf6cc6dea/qef.py#L57)
, I use [numpy’s
lstsq](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.14.0/reference/generated/numpy.linalg.lstsq.html)
function.

## Problems

### Colinear normals

Most tutorials would stop here but it’s a dirty secret that solving the
QEF as described in the original Dual Contouring paper doesn’t actually
work very well.

If you solve the QEF, you can find the point that is most consistent
with the normals of the function. But there’s **no actual guarantee that
the resulting point is inside the cell**.

In fact, it’s quite common for it not to be if you have large flat
surfaces. In that case all the sampled normals are the same or very
close, as in this diagram.

<figure>
<img src="//www.boristhebrave.com/content/2018/04/dc_colinear.svg"
decoding="async" />
</figure>

I’ve seen a lot of advice dealing with this particular problem. Several
people have given up on using the gradient information, instead taking
the center of the cell, or average of the boundary positions. This is
called Surface Nets, and it at least has simplicity going for it.

But what I’d recommend based on my own experiments is the combination of
two techniques.

#### Technique 1: Constrained QEF solving

Recall we were finding the cell point by finding the point that
minimized the value of a given function, called the QEF. With some small
changes, we can find the minimizing point *within* the cell.

#### Technique 2: Biasing the QEF

We can add any quadratic function we like to the QEF and we get another
quadratic function which is still solvable. So I add a quadratic which
has a minimal point in the center of the cell.\
This has the effect of pulling the solution of the overall QEF towards
the center.\
In fact, it has a stronger effect when the normals are colinear and
likely to give screwy results, while it barely affects the positions for
the good case.

Using both techniques is somewhat redundant, but I think it gives the
best visual results.

Better details on both techniques are demonstrated [in the
code](https://github.com/BorisTheBrave/mc-dc/blob/a165b326849d8814fb03c963ad33a9faf6cc6dea/qef.py#L87)
.

### Self interesctions

Another dual contouring annoyance is it can sometimes generate a 3d
surface that intersects itself. For most uses, this is completely
ignorable, so I have not addressed it.

There is a paper discussing how to deal with it: [“Intersection-free
Contouring on An Octree Grid” Ju and Udeshi
2006](http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~taoju/research/interfree_paper_final.pdf)

### Manifolds

While a dual contouring mesh is always water tight, it’s not always a
well defined surface. As there’s only one point per cell, if two
surfaces pass through a cell, they will share it. This is called a
“non-manifold” mesh, and it can mess with some texturing algorithms.
This issue is common if you have solids that are thinner than the cell
size, or multiple objects nearly touching each other.

<figure>
<img src="//www.boristhebrave.com/content/2018/04/dc_nonmanifold.svg"
decoding="async" />
</figure>

Handling these cases is a substantial extension on basic Dual
Contouring. If you need this feature I recommend having a look at [this
Dual Contouring implementation](https://github.com/Lin20/isosurface) or
[this
paper](http://faculty.cs.tamu.edu/schaefer/research/dualsimp_tvcg.pdf)

## Extensions

Because of the relative simplicity of the meshing process, Dual
Contouring is much easier to extend to cell layouts other than the
standard grid used above. Most commonly, you can run it on an
[octtree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octree) to have varying sizes of
cells precisely where you need the detail. The rough idea is identical –
pick a point per cell using sampled normals, then for each edge showing
a sign change find the adjacent 4 cells and combine their vertices into
a face. With an octree, you can recurse to find those edges, and the
adjacent cells. Matt Keeter has a [detailed
tutorial](https://www.mattkeeter.com/projects/contours/) on what to do.

Another neat extension is that all you need for Dual Contouring is a
measure of what is inside / outside, and corresponding normals. Though
I’ve assumed you have a function for this, you can also derive the same
information from another mesh. This allows you to “remesh”, i.e.
generate a clean set of vertices and faces that cleans up the original
mesh. For example, Blender’s [remesh
modifier](https://docs.blender.org/manual/de/dev/modeling/modifiers/generate/remesh.html).

Well, that’s all I’ve got time for. Let me know in the comments if you
found it useful, or if there’s anything else you’d like me to explain.
