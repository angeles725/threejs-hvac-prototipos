This article is one in a series of articles about three.js. The first
article was [about three.js fundamentals](fundamentals.html). The
[previous article](setup.html) was about setting up for this article. If
you haven't read that yet you might want to start there.

Textures are a kind of large topic in Three.js and I'm not 100% sure at
what level to explain them but I will try. There are many topics and
many of them interrelate so it's hard to explain them all at once.
Here's quick table of contents for this article.

## <span id="hello"></span> Hello Texture

Textures are *generally* images that are most often created in some 3rd
party program like Photoshop or GIMP. For example let's put this image
on cube.

<div class="threejs_center">

<img src="../examples/resources/images/wall.jpg" class="border"
style="width: 600px;" />

</div>

We'll modify one of our first samples. All we need to do is create a
[`TextureLoader`](/docs/#api/en/loaders/TextureLoader). Call its
[`load`](/docs/#api/en/loaders/TextureLoader#load) method with the URL
of an image and set the material's `map` property to the result instead
of setting its `color`.

``` prettyprint
+const loader = new THREE.TextureLoader();
+const texture = loader.load( 'resources/images/wall.jpg' );
+texture.colorSpace = THREE.SRGBColorSpace;

const material = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({
-  color: 0xFF8844,
+  map: texture,
});
```

Note that we're using
[`MeshBasicMaterial`](/docs/#api/en/materials/MeshBasicMaterial) so no
need for any lights.

## <span id="six"></span> 6 Textures, a different one on each face of a cube

How about 6 textures, one on each face of a cube?

<div class="threejs_center">

<div>

<img src="../examples/resources/images/flower-1.jpg" class="border"
style="width: 100px;" />
<img src="../examples/resources/images/flower-2.jpg" class="border"
style="width: 100px;" />
<img src="../examples/resources/images/flower-3.jpg" class="border"
style="width: 100px;" />

</div>

<div>

<img src="../examples/resources/images/flower-4.jpg" class="border"
style="width: 100px;" />
<img src="../examples/resources/images/flower-5.jpg" class="border"
style="width: 100px;" />
<img src="../examples/resources/images/flower-6.jpg" class="border"
style="width: 100px;" />

</div>

</div>

We just make 6 materials and pass them as an array when we create the
[`Mesh`](/docs/#api/en/objects/Mesh)

``` prettyprint
const loader = new THREE.TextureLoader();
-const texture = loader.load( 'resources/images/wall.jpg' );
-texture.colorSpace = THREE.SRGBColorSpace;

-const material = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({
-  map: texture,
-});
+const materials = [
+  new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({map: loadColorTexture('resources/images/flower-1.jpg')}),
+  new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({map: loadColorTexture('resources/images/flower-2.jpg')}),
+  new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({map: loadColorTexture('resources/images/flower-3.jpg')}),
+  new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({map: loadColorTexture('resources/images/flower-4.jpg')}),
+  new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({map: loadColorTexture('resources/images/flower-5.jpg')}),
+  new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({map: loadColorTexture('resources/images/flower-6.jpg')}),
+];
-const cube = new THREE.Mesh(geometry, material);
+const cube = new THREE.Mesh(geometry, materials);

+function loadColorTexture( path ) {
+  const texture = loader.load( path );
+  texture.colorSpace = THREE.SRGBColorSpace;
+  return texture;
+}
```

It works!

window</a>

</div>

It should be noted though that not all geometry types supports multiple
materials. [`BoxGeometry`](/docs/#api/en/geometries/BoxGeometry) can use
6 materials one for each face.
[`ConeGeometry`](/docs/#api/en/geometries/ConeGeometry) can use 2
materials, one for the bottom and one for the cone.
[`CylinderGeometry`](/docs/#api/en/geometries/CylinderGeometry) can use
3 materials, bottom, top, and side. For other cases you will need to
build or load custom geometry and/or modify texture coordinates.

It's far more common in other 3D engines and far more performant to use
a [Texture Atlas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texture_atlas) if you
want to allow multiple images on a single geometry. A Texture atlas is
where you put multiple images in a single texture and then use texture
coordinates on the vertices of your geometry to select which parts of a
texture are used on each triangle in your geometry.

What are texture coordinates? They are data added to each vertex of a
piece of geometry that specify what part of the texture corresponds to
that specific vertex. We'll go over them when we start [building custom
geometry](custom-buffergeometry.html).

## <span id="loading"></span> Loading Textures

### <span id="easy"></span> The Easy Way

Most of the code on this site uses the easiest method of loading
textures. We create a
[`TextureLoader`](/docs/#api/en/loaders/TextureLoader) and then call its
[`load`](/docs/#api/en/loaders/TextureLoader#load) method. This returns
a [`Texture`](/docs/#api/en/textures/Texture) object.

``` prettyprint
const texture = loader.load('resources/images/flower-1.jpg');
```

It's important to note that using this method our texture will be
transparent until the image is loaded asynchronously by three.js at
which point it will update the texture with the downloaded image.

This has the big advantage that we don't have to wait for the texture to
load and our page will start rendering immediately. That's probably okay
for a great many use cases but if we want we can ask three.js to tell us
when the texture has finished downloading.

### <span id="wait1"></span> Waiting for a texture to load

To wait for a texture to load the `load` method of the texture loader
takes a callback that will be called when the texture has finished
loading. Going back to our top example we can wait for the texture to
load before creating our [`Mesh`](/docs/#api/en/objects/Mesh) and adding
it to scene like this

``` prettyprint
const loader = new THREE.TextureLoader();
loader.load('resources/images/wall.jpg', (texture) => {
  texture.colorSpace = THREE.SRGBColorSpace;
  const material = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({
    map: texture,
  });
  const cube = new THREE.Mesh(geometry, material);
  scene.add(cube);
  cubes.push(cube);  // add to our list of cubes to rotate
});
```

Unless you clear your browser's cache and have a slow connection you're
unlikely to see the any difference but rest assured it is waiting for
the texture to load.

class="threejs_center" target="_blank">click here to open in a separate
window</a>

</div>

### <span id="waitmany"></span> Waiting for multiple textures to load

To wait until all textures have loaded you can use a
[`LoadingManager`](/docs/#api/en/loaders/managers/LoadingManager).
Create one and pass it to the
[`TextureLoader`](/docs/#api/en/loaders/TextureLoader) then set its
[`onLoad`](/docs/#api/en/loaders/managers/LoadingManager#onLoad)
property to a callback.

``` prettyprint
+const loadManager = new THREE.LoadingManager();
*const loader = new THREE.TextureLoader(loadManager);

const materials = [
  new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({map: loader.load('resources/images/flower-1.jpg')}),
  new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({map: loader.load('resources/images/flower-2.jpg')}),
  new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({map: loader.load('resources/images/flower-3.jpg')}),
  new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({map: loader.load('resources/images/flower-4.jpg')}),
  new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({map: loader.load('resources/images/flower-5.jpg')}),
  new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({map: loader.load('resources/images/flower-6.jpg')}),
];

+loadManager.onLoad = () => {
+  const cube = new THREE.Mesh(geometry, materials);
+  scene.add(cube);
+  cubes.push(cube);  // add to our list of cubes to rotate
+};
```

The [`LoadingManager`](/docs/#api/en/loaders/managers/LoadingManager)
also has an
[`onProgress`](/docs/#api/en/loaders/managers/LoadingManager#onProgress)
property we can set to another callback to show a progress indicator.

First we'll add a progress bar in HTML

``` prettyprint
<body>
  <canvas id="c"></canvas>
+  <div id="loading">
+    <div class="progress"><div class="progressbar"></div></div>
+  </div>
</body>
```

and the CSS for it

``` prettyprint
#loading {
    position: fixed;
    top: 0;
    left: 0;
    width: 100%;
    height: 100%;
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
}
#loading .progress {
    margin: 1.5em;
    border: 1px solid white;
    width: 50vw;
}
#loading .progressbar {
    margin: 2px;
    background: white;
    height: 1em;
    transform-origin: top left;
    transform: scaleX(0);
}
```

Then in the code we'll update the scale of the `progressbar` in our
`onProgress` callback. It gets called with the URL of the last item
loaded, the number of items loaded so far, and the total number of items
loaded.

``` prettyprint
+const loadingElem = document.querySelector('#loading');
+const progressBarElem = loadingElem.querySelector('.progressbar');

loadManager.onLoad = () => {
+  loadingElem.style.display = 'none';
  const cube = new THREE.Mesh(geometry, materials);
  scene.add(cube);
  cubes.push(cube);  // add to our list of cubes to rotate
};

+loadManager.onProgress = (urlOfLastItemLoaded, itemsLoaded, itemsTotal) => {
+  const progress = itemsLoaded / itemsTotal;
+  progressBarElem.style.transform = `scaleX(${progress})`;
+};
```

Unless you clear your cache and have a slow connection you might not see
the loading bar.

## <span id="cors"></span> Loading textures from other origins

To use images from other servers those servers need to send the correct
headers. If they don't you cannot use the images in three.js and will
get an error. If you run the server providing the images make sure it
[sends the correct
headers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS). If you
don't control the server hosting the images and it does not send the
permission headers then you can't use the images from that server.

For example [imgur](https://imgur.com), [flickr](https://flickr.com),
and [github](https://github.com) all send headers allowing you to use
images hosted on their servers in three.js. Most other websites do not.

## <span id="memory"></span> Memory Usage

Textures are often the part of a three.js app that use the most memory.
It's important to understand that *in general*, textures take
`width * height * 4 * 1.33` bytes of memory.

Notice that says nothing about compression. I can make a .jpg image and
set its compression super high. For example let's say I was making a
scene of a house. Inside the house there is a table and I decide to put
this wood texture on the top surface of the table

<div class="threejs_center">

<img src="../resources/images/compressed-but-large-wood-texture.jpg"
class="border" style="width: 300px" data-align="center" />

</div>

That image is only 157k so it will download relatively quickly but [it
is actually 3024 x 3761 pixels in
size](resources/images/compressed-but-large-wood-texture.jpg). Following
the equation above that's

``` prettyprint
3024 * 3761 * 4 * 1.33 = 60505764.5
```

That image will take **60 MEG OF MEMORY!** in three.js. A few textures
like that and you'll be out of memory.

I bring this up because it's important to know that using textures has a
hidden cost. In order for three.js to use the texture it has to hand it
off to the GPU and the GPU *in general* requires the texture data to be
uncompressed.

The moral of the story is make your textures small in dimensions not
just small in file size. Small in file size = fast to download. Small in
dimensions = takes less memory. How small should you make them? As small
as you can and still look as good as you need them to look.

## <span id="format"></span> JPG vs PNG

This is pretty much the same as regular HTML in that JPGs have lossy
compression, PNGs have lossless compression so PNGs are generally slower
to download. But, PNGs support transparency. PNGs are also probably the
appropriate format for non-image data like normal maps, and other kinds
of non-image maps which we'll go over later.

It's important to remember that a JPG doesn't use less memory than a PNG
in WebGL. See above.

## <span id="filtering-and-mips"></span> Filtering and Mips

Let's apply this 16x16 texture

<div class="threejs_center">

<img src="../resources/images/mip-low-res-enlarged.png" class="nobg"
data-align="center" />

</div>

To a cube

<div class="spread">

<div diagram="filterCube">

</div>

</div>

Let's draw that cube really small

<div class="spread">

<div diagram="filterCubeSmall">

</div>

</div>

Hmmm, I guess that's hard to see. Let's magnify that tiny cube

<div class="spread">

<div diagram="filterCubeSmallLowRes">

</div>

</div>

How does the GPU know which colors to make each pixel it's drawing for
the tiny cube? What if the cube was so small that it's just 1 or 2
pixels?

This is what filtering is about.

If it was Photoshop, Photoshop would average nearly all the pixels
together to figure out what color to make those 1 or 2 pixels. That
would be a very slow operation. GPUs solve this issue using mipmaps.

Mips are copies of the texture, each one half as wide and half as tall
as the previous mip where the pixels have been blended to make the next
smaller mip. Mips are created until we get all the way to a 1x1 pixel
mip. For the image above all of the mips would end up being something
like this

<div class="threejs_center">

<img src="../resources/images/mipmap-low-res-enlarged.png" class="nobg"
data-align="center" />

</div>

Now, when the cube is drawn so small that it's only 1 or 2 pixels large
the GPU can choose to use just the smallest or next to smallest mip
level to decide what color to make the tiny cube.

In three.js you can choose what happens both when the texture is drawn
larger than its original size and what happens when it's drawn smaller
than its original size.

For setting the filter when the texture is drawn larger than its
original size you set
[`texture.magFilter`](/docs/#api/en/textures/Texture#magFilter) property
to either `THREE.NearestFilter` or `THREE.LinearFilter`. `NearestFilter`
means just pick the closet single pixel from the original texture. With
a low resolution texture this gives you a very pixelated look like
Minecraft.

`LinearFilter` means choose the 4 pixels from the texture that are
closest to the where we should be choosing a color from and blend them
in the appropriate proportions relative to how far away the actual point
is from each of the 4 pixels.

<div class="spread">

<div>

<div diagram="filterCubeMagNearest" style="height: 250px;">

</div>

<div class="code">

</div>

</div>

<div>

<div diagram="filterCubeMagLinear" style="height: 250px;">

</div>

<div class="code">

Linear

</div>

</div>

</div>

For setting the filter when the texture is drawn smaller than its
original size you set the
[`texture.minFilter`](/docs/#api/en/textures/Texture#minFilter) property
to one of 6 values.

- `THREE.NearestFilter`

  same as above, choose the closest pixel in the texture

- `THREE.LinearFilter`

  same as above, choose 4 pixels from the texture and blend them

- `THREE.NearestMipmapNearestFilter`

  choose the appropriate mip then choose one pixel

- `THREE.NearestMipmapLinearFilter`

  choose 2 mips, choose one pixel from each, blend the 2 pixels

- `THREE.LinearMipmapNearestFilter`

  chose the appropriate mip then choose 4 pixels and blend them

- `THREE.LinearMipmapLinearFilter`

  choose 2 mips, choose 4 pixels from each and blend all 8 into 1 pixel

Here's an example showing all 6 settings

<div class="spread">

<div diagram="filterModes" style="
    height: 450px;
    position: relative;
  ">

<div style="
      width: 100%;
      height: 100%;
      display: flex;
      align-items: center;
      justify-content: flex-start;
    ">

<div style="
        background: rgba(255,0,0,.8);
        color: white;
        padding: .5em;
        margin: 1em;
        font-size: small;
        border-radius: .5em;
        line-height: 1.2;
        user-select: none;">

<div class="filter-caption"

</div>

</div>

</div>

One thing to notice is the top left and top middle using `NearestFilter`
and `LinearFilter` don't use the mips. Because of that they flicker in
the distance because the GPU is picking pixels from the original
texture. On the left just one pixel is chosen and in the middle 4 are
chosen and blended but it's not enough come up with a good
representative color. The other 4 strips do better with the bottom
right, `LinearMipmapLinearFilter` being best.

If you click the picture above it will toggle between the texture we've
been using above and a texture where every mip level is a different
color.

<div class="threejs_center">

<div texture-diagram="differentColoredMips">

</div>

</div>

This makes it more clear what is happening. You can see in the top left
and top middle the first mip is used all the way into the distance. The
top right and bottom middle you can clearly see where a different mip is
used.

Switching back to the original texture you can see the bottom right is
the smoothest, highest quality. You might ask why not always use that
mode. The most obvious reason is sometimes you want things to be
pixelated for a retro look or some other reason. The next most common
reason is that reading 8 pixels and blending them is slower than reading
1 pixel and blending. While it's unlikely that a single texture is going
to be the difference between fast and slow as we progress further into
these articles we'll eventually have materials that use 4 or 5 textures
all at once. 4 textures \* 8 pixels per texture is looking up 32 pixels
for ever pixel rendered. This can be especially important to consider on
mobile devices.

## <span id="uvmanipulation"></span> Repeating, offseting, rotating, wrapping a texture

Textures have settings for repeating, offseting, and rotating a texture.

By default textures in three.js do not repeat. To set whether or not a
texture repeats there are 2 properties,
[`wrapS`](/docs/#api/en/textures/Texture#wrapS) for horizontal wrapping
and [`wrapT`](/docs/#api/en/textures/Texture#wrapT) for vertical
wrapping.

They can be set to one of:

- `THREE.ClampToEdgeWrapping`

  the last pixel on each edge is repeated forever

- `THREE.RepeatWrapping`

  the texture is repeated

- `THREE.MirroredRepeatWrapping`

  the texture is mirrored and repeated

For example to turn on wrapping in both directions:

``` prettyprint
someTexture.wrapS = THREE.RepeatWrapping;
someTexture.wrapT = THREE.RepeatWrapping;
```

Repeating is set with the \[repeat\] repeat property.

``` prettyprint
const timesToRepeatHorizontally = 4;
const timesToRepeatVertically = 2;
someTexture.repeat.set(timesToRepeatHorizontally, timesToRepeatVertically);
```

Offseting the texture can be done by setting the `offset` property.
Textures are offset with units where 1 unit = 1 texture size. On other
words 0 = no offset and 1 = offset one full texture amount.

``` prettyprint
const xOffset = .5;   // offset by half the texture
const yOffset = .25;  // offset by 1/4 the texture
someTexture.offset.set(xOffset, yOffset);
```

Rotating the texture can be set by setting the `rotation` property in
radians as well as the `center` property for choosing the center of
rotation. It defaults to 0,0 which rotates from the bottom left corner.
Like offset these units are in texture size so setting them to `.5, .5`
would rotate around the center of the texture.

``` prettyprint
someTexture.center.set(.5, .5);
someTexture.rotation = THREE.MathUtils.degToRad(45);
```

Let's modify the top sample above to play with these values

First we'll keep a reference to the texture so we can manipulate it

``` prettyprint
+const texture = loader.load('resources/images/wall.jpg');
const material = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({
-  map: loader.load('resources/images/wall.jpg');
+  map: texture,
});
```

Then we'll use [lil-gui](https://github.com/georgealways/lil-gui) again
to provide a simple interface.

``` prettyprint
import {GUI} from 'three/addons/libs/lil-gui.module.min.js';
```

As we did in previous lil-gui examples we'll use a simple class to give
lil-gui an object that it can manipulate in degrees but that will set a
property in radians.

``` prettyprint
class DegRadHelper {
  constructor(obj, prop) {
    this.obj = obj;
    this.prop = prop;
  }
  get value() {
    return THREE.MathUtils.radToDeg(this.obj[this.prop]);
  }
  set value(v) {
    this.obj[this.prop] = THREE.MathUtils.degToRad(v);
  }
}
```

We also need a class that will convert from a string like `"123"` into a
number like `123` since three.js requires numbers for enum settings like
`wrapS` and `wrapT` but lil-gui only uses strings for enums.

``` prettyprint
class StringToNumberHelper {
  constructor(obj, prop) {
    this.obj = obj;
    this.prop = prop;
  }
  get value() {
    return this.obj[this.prop];
  }
  set value(v) {
    this.obj[this.prop] = parseFloat(v);
  }
}
```

Using those classes we can setup a simple GUI for the settings above

``` prettyprint
const wrapModes = {
  'ClampToEdgeWrapping': THREE.ClampToEdgeWrapping,
  'RepeatWrapping': THREE.RepeatWrapping,
  'MirroredRepeatWrapping': THREE.MirroredRepeatWrapping,
};

function updateTexture() {
  texture.needsUpdate = true;
}

const gui = new GUI();
gui.add(new StringToNumberHelper(texture, 'wrapS'), 'value', wrapModes)
  .name('texture.wrapS')
  .onChange(updateTexture);
gui.add(new StringToNumberHelper(texture, 'wrapT'), 'value', wrapModes)
  .name('texture.wrapT')
  .onChange(updateTexture);
gui.add(texture.repeat, 'x', 0, 5, .01).name('texture.repeat.x');
gui.add(texture.repeat, 'y', 0, 5, .01).name('texture.repeat.y');
gui.add(texture.offset, 'x', -2, 2, .01).name('texture.offset.x');
gui.add(texture.offset, 'y', -2, 2, .01).name('texture.offset.y');
gui.add(texture.center, 'x', -.5, 1.5, .01).name('texture.center.x');
gui.add(texture.center, 'y', -.5, 1.5, .01).name('texture.center.y');
gui.add(new DegRadHelper(texture, 'rotation'), 'value', -360, 360)
  .name('texture.rotation');
```

The last thing to note about the example is that if you change `wrapS`
or `wrapT` on the texture you must also set
[`texture.needsUpdate`](/docs/#api/en/textures/Texture#needsUpdate) so
three.js knows to apply those settings. The other settings are
automatically applied.

This is only one step into the topic of textures. At some point we'll go
over texture coordinates as well as 9 other types of textures that can
be applied to materials.

For now let's move on to [lights](lights.html).
