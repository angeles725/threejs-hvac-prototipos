<div id="brief" class="section">

## In Brief

Goal  
Color is not the only way of distinguishing information.

What to do  
Use information in addition to color, such as shape or text, to convey
meaning.

Why it's important  
Not everyone sees colors or sees them the same way.

</div>

<div id="success-criterion" class="section box">

## Success Criterion (SC)

<div class="box-i">

Color is not used as the only visual means of conveying information,
indicating an action, prompting a response, or distinguishing a visual
element.

<div class="note">

Note

This success criterion addresses color perception specifically. Other
forms of perception are covered in [Guideline
1.3](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#adaptable) including programmatic
access to color and other visual presentation coding.

</div>

</div>

</div>

<div id="intent" class="section">

## Intent

The intent of this success criterion is to ensure that all sighted users
can access information that is conveyed by color differences, that is,
by the use of color where each color has a meaning assigned to it. If
the information is conveyed through color differences in an image (or
other non-text format), the color may not be seen by users with color
deficiencies. In this case, providing the information conveyed with
color through another visual means ensures users who cannot see color
can still perceive the information.

Color is an important asset in the design of web content, enhancing its
aesthetic appeal, its usability, and its accessibility. However, some
users have difficulty perceiving color. People with partial sight often
experience limited color vision, and many older users do not see color
well. In addition, people using limited-color or monochrome displays and
browsers will be unable to access information that is presented only in
color.

Examples of information conveyed by color differences: “required fields
are red", “error is shown in red", and “Mary's sales are in red, Tom's
are in blue". Examples of indications of an action include: using color
to indicate that a link will open in a new window or that a database
entry has been updated successfully. An example of prompting a response
would be: using highlighting on form fields to indicate that a required
field had been left blank.

<div class="note">

Note

<div>

This should not in any way discourage the use of color on a page, or
even color coding if it is complemented by other visual indication.

</div>

</div>

<div class="note">

Note

<div>

If content is conveyed through the use of colors that differ not only in
their hue, but that also have a significant difference in lightness,
then this counts as an additional visual distinction, as long as the
difference in relative luminance between the colors leads to a contrast
ratio of 3:1 or greater. For example, a light green and a dark red
differ **both** by color (hue) **and** by lightness, so they would pass
if the contrast ratio is at least 3:1. Similarly, if content is
distinguished by inverting an element's foreground and background
colors, this would pass (again, assuming that the foreground and
background colors have a sufficient contrast).

However, if content relies on the user's ability to accurately perceive
or differentiate a particular color an additional visual indicator will
be required regardless of the contrast ratio between those colors. For
example, knowing whether an outline is green for valid or red for
invalid.

</div>

</div>

<div class="note">

Note

<div>

This criterion does not apply to situations where color has *not* been
used to convey information, indicate an action, prompt a response or
distinguish a visual element. For instance, a hyperlink which has been
styled to appear no different than neighboring static text would not
fail this success criterion, as there would be no color differentiation
between the actionable hyperlink text and the adjacent static text. Such
lack of styling differentiation could result in poor usability for
anyone looking at the interface, regardless of disability.

</div>

</div>

<div class="note">

Note

<div>

This criterion does not directly address the needs of users with
assistive technologies. It aims to ensure that sighted users who cannot
distinguish between some colors can still understand content. How
information is conveyed to assistive technology users is covered
separately in other criteria, including (but not limited to) [1.1.1
Non-text Content](non-text-content), [1.3.1 Info and
Relationships](info-and-relationships), and [4.1.2 Name, Role,
Value](name-role-value).

Conversely, even if information that is conveyed by color differences is
appropriately conveyed to assistive technologies, it does not
necessarily pass this criterion, as sighted users who cannot distinguish
between certain color may not necessarily be using any assistive
technologies. This criterion requires a visible alternative to color.

<div class="note">

Note

<div>

Most user agents provide users with a color-only cue that a link has
been previously activated by them ("visited"). However, several
technical constraints result in authors having very limited control over
these color-only indications of visited links. The technical constraints
are as follows:

- User agents constrain the exposure of a link's visited state due to
  [privacy
  concerns](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Privacy_and_the_:visited_selector).
  Author queries to user agents will indicate all links have not been
  visited.
- Any available information on the visited state of a link would be
  inaccurate since it is both user and browser-dependent. Even if an
  author could accurately get information on previously activated links
  by a certain user, the author would be constrained to the current
  browser's preserved history, and would be unable to determine if the
  user had visited the page using a different browser (or if the history
  was not preserved, either from cache clearing or use of private
  sessions).
- Authors can *only* use color to modify the `:visited` CSS pseudoclass
  style. The technology constrains any non-color styling. Due to palette
  limitations, an author cannot use color alone to achieve 3:1 contrast
  between link and non-link text as well as between visited and
  unvisited links while also achieving 4.5:1 contrast for all link and
  non-link text.
- Authors also cannot set the visited state of links. The anchor element
  does not include a "visited" attribute; therefore the author has no
  ability to alter the state through an attribute setting. As such,
  authors cannot achieve [1.3.1 Info and
  Relationships](info-and-relationships) or [4.1.2 Name, Role,
  Value](name-role-value) in regard to visited links.

For these reasons, setting or conveying a link's visited status is not
an author responsibility. Where color alone distinguishes between
visited and unvisited links, it does not result in a failure of this
Success Criterion, even where the contrast between the two link colors
is below 3:1. Note that authors must continue to ensure that all text
links meet contrast minimums against the page background (SC 1.4.3).

<div id="benefits" class="section">

## Benefits

- Users with partial sight often experience limited color vision.
- Some older users may not be able to see color well.
- Users with color vision deficiency who cannot distinguish between
  certain colors benefit when information conveyed by color is available
  in other visual ways.
- People using limited color monochrome displays may be unable to access
  color-dependent information.
- Users who have problems distinguishing between colors can look or
  listen for text cues.

</div>

<div id="examples" class="section">

## Examples

A form that uses color and text to indicate required fields  
A form contains both required and optional fields. Instructions at the
top of the form explain that required fields are labeled with red text
and also with an icon. Users who cannot perceive the difference between
the optional field labels and the red labels for the required fields
will still be able to see the icon next to the red labels.

An examination  
Students view an SVG image of a chemical compound and identify the
chemical elements present based **both** on the colors used, as well as
numbers next to each element. A legend shows the color and number for
each type of element. Sighted users who cannot perceive all the color
differences can still understand the image by relying on the numbers.
