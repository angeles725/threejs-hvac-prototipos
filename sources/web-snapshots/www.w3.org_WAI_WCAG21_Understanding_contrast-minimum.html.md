## Success Criterion (SC)

<div class="box-i">

The visual presentation of [text](#dfn-text) and [images of
text](#dfn-image-of-text) has a [contrast ratio](#dfn-contrast-ratio) of
at least 4.5:1, except for the following:

Large Text  
[Large-scale](#dfn-large-scale) text and images of large-scale text have
a contrast ratio of at least 3:1;

Incidental  
Text or images of text that are part of an inactive [user interface
component](#dfn-user-interface-component), that are [pure
decoration](#dfn-pure-decoration), that are not visible to anyone, or
that are part of a picture that contains significant other visual
content, have no contrast requirement.

Logotypes  
Text that is part of a logo or brand name has no contrast requirement.

</div>

</div>

<div id="intent" class="section">

## Intent

The intent of this success criterion is to provide enough contrast
between text and its background, so that it can be read by people with
moderately low vision or impaired contrast perception, without the use
of contrast-enhancing assistive technology.

For all consumers of visual content, adequate light-dark contrast is
needed between the relative luminance of text and its background for
good readability. Many different visual impairments can substantially
impact contrast sensitivity, requiring more light-dark contrast,
regardless of color (hue). For people with color vision deficiency who
are not able to distinguish certain shades of color, hue and saturation
have minimal or no effect on legibility as assessed by reading
performance. Further, the inability to distinguish certain shades of
color does not negatively affect light-dark contrast perception.
Therefore, in the recommendation, contrast is calculated in such a way
that color (hue) is not a key factor.

Text that is decorative and conveys no information is excluded. For
example, if random words are used to create a background and the words
could be rearranged or substituted without changing meaning, then it
would be decorative and would not need to meet this criterion.

Text that is larger and has wider character strokes is easier to read at
lower contrast. The contrast requirement for larger text is therefore
lower. This allows authors to use a wider range of color choices for
large text, which is helpful for design of pages, particularly titles.
18 point text or 14 point bold text is judged to be large enough to
require a lower contrast ratio. (See The American Printing House for the
Blind Guidelines for Large Printing and The Library of Congress
Guidelines for Large Print under [Resources](#resources)). "18 point"
and "bold" can both have different meanings in different fonts but,
except for very thin or unusual fonts, they should be sufficient. Since
there are so many different fonts, the general measures are used and a
note regarding thin or unusual fonts is included in the definition for
[large-scale](#dfn-large-scale) text.

<div class="note">

Note

<div>

When evaluating this Success Criterion, the font size in points should
be obtained from the user agent or calculated on font metrics in the way
that user agents do. Point sizes are based on the CSS `pt` size as
defined in [CSS3
Values](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-3/#reference-pixel). The ratio
between sizes in points and CSS pixels is `1pt = 1.333px`, therefore
`14pt` and `18pt` are equivalent to approximately `18.5px` and `24px`.

Because different image editing applications default to different pixel
densities (e.g., `72ppi` or `96ppi`), specifying point sizes for fonts
from within an image editing application can be unreliable when it comes
to presenting text at a specific size. When creating images of
large-scale text, authors should ensure that the text in the resulting
image is roughly equivalent to 1.2 and 1.5 em or to 120% or 150% of the
default size for body text. For example, for a `72ppi` image, an author
would need to use approximately 19pt and 24pt font sizes in order to
successfully present images of large-scale text to a user.

The 3:1 and 4.5:1 contrast ratios referenced in this success criterion
are intended to be treated as threshold values. When comparing the
computed contrast ratio to the Success Criterion ratio, the computed
values should not be rounded (e.g., 4.499:1 would not meet the 4.5:1
threshold).

</div>

</div>

<div class="note">

Note

<div>

Because authors do not have control over user settings for font
smoothing/anti-aliasing, when evaluating this Success Criterion, refer
to the foreground and background colors obtained from the user agent, or
the underlying markup and stylesheets, rather than the text as presented
on screen.

Due to anti-aliasing, particularly thin or unusual fonts may be rendered
by user agents with a much fainter color than the actual text color
defined in the underlying CSS. This can lead to situations where text
has a contrast ratio that nominally passes the Success Criterion, but
has a much lower contrast in practice. In these cases, best practice
would be for authors to choose a font with stronger/thicker lines, or to
aim for a foreground/background color combination that exceeds the
normative requirements of this success criterion.

</div>

</div>

The contrast requirements for text also apply to images of text (text
that has been rendered into pixels and then stored in an image format) -
see [Success Criterion 1.4.5 Images of Text](images-of-text).

This requirement applies to situations in which images of text were
intended to be understood as text. Incidental text, such as in
photographs that happen to include a street sign, are not included. Nor
is text that for some reason is designed to be invisible to all viewers.
Stylized text, such as in corporate logos, should be treated in terms of
its function on the page, which may or may not warrant including the
content in the text alternative. Corporate identity or brand guidelines
beyond logo and logotype are not included in the exception.

In this provision there is an exception that reads "that are part of a
picture that contains significant other visual content,". This exception
is intended to separate pictures that have text in them from images of
text that are done to replace text in order to get a particular look.

<div class="note">

Note

<div>

Images of text do not scale as well as text because they tend to
pixelate. It is also harder to change foreground and background contrast
and color combinations for images of text, which is necessary for some
users. Therefore, we suggest using text wherever possible, and when not,
consider supplying an image of higher resolution.

</div>

</div>

This success criterion applies to text in the page, including
placeholder text and text that is shown when a pointer is hovering over
an object or when an object has keyboard focus. If any of these are used
in a page, the text needs to provide sufficient contrast.

Although this success criterion only applies to text, similar issues
occur for content presented in charts, graphs, diagrams, and other
non-text-based information, which is covered by [Success Criterion
1.4.11 Non-Text Contrast](non-text-contrast).

See also [1.4.6 Contrast (Enhanced)](contrast-enhanced).

<div class="note">

Note

<div>

Text used as part of a logo or logotype is exempted from contrast
requirements, under the assumption that logos/logotypes must comply with
stricter color choices mandated by corporate identity or brand
guidelines. However, this can be problematic when logos or logotypes act
as [user interface components](#dfn-user-interface-component) (such as a
link or other interactive control). In these cases, as a best practice,
authors should consider choosing a variant of the logo or logotype that
has sufficient text contrast, if allowed by the corporate identity or
brand guidelines. Alternatively, authors should consider providing an
equivalent [user interface component](#dfn-user-interface-component)
which serves the same purpose and meets contrast requirements.

</div>

</div>

<div id="rationale-for-the-ratios-chosen" class="section">

### Rationale for the Ratios Chosen

A contrast ratio of 3:1 is the minimum level recommended by
\[[ISO-9241-3](#ISO-9241-3)\] and
\[[ANSI-HFES-100-1988](#ANSI-HFES-100-1988)\] for standard text and
vision. The 4.5:1 ratio is used in this success criterion to account for
the loss in contrast that results from moderately low visual acuity,
congenital or acquired color deficiencies, or the loss of contrast
sensitivity that typically accompanies aging.

The rationale is based on a) adoption of the 3:1 contrast ratio for
minimum acceptable contrast for normal observers, in the ANSI standard,
and b) the empirical finding that in the population, visual acuity of
20/40 is associated with a contrast sensitivity loss of roughly 1.5
\[[ARDITI-FAYE](#ARDITI-FAYE)\]. A user with 20/40 would thus require a
contrast ratio of `3 * 1.5 = 4.5 to 1`. Following analogous empirical
findings and the same logic, the user with 20/80 visual acuity would
require contrast of about 7:1. This ratio is used in Success Criterion
1.4.6.

Hues are perceived differently by users with color vision deficiencies
(both congenital and acquired) resulting in different colors and
relative luminance contrasts than for normally sighted users. Because of
this, effective contrast and readability are different for this
population. However, color deficiencies are so diverse that prescribing
effective general use color pairs (for contrast) based on quantitative
data is not feasible. Requiring good luminance contrast accommodates
this by requiring contrast that is independent of color perception.
Fortunately, most of the luminance contribution is from the mid and long
wave receptors which largely overlap in their spectral responses. The
result is that effective luminance contrast can generally be computed
without regard to specific color deficiency, except for the use of
predominantly long wavelength colors against darker colors (generally
appearing black) for those who have protanopia. (We provide an advisory
technique on avoiding red on black for that reason). For more
information see \[[ARDITI-KNOBLAUCH-1994](#ARDITI-KNOBLAUCH-1994)\]
\[[ARDITI-KNOBLAUCH-1996](#ARDITI-KNOBLAUCH-1996)\]
\[[ARDITI](#ARDITI)\].

<div class="note">

Note

<div>

Some people with cognitive disabilities require color combinations or
hues that have low contrast, and therefore we allow and encourage
authors to provide mechanisms to adjust the foreground and background
colors of the content. Some of the combinations that could be chosen may
have contrast levels that will be lower than those specified here. This
is not a violation of this Success Criterion, provided there is a
mechanism that will return to the required values set out here.

</div>

</div>

The contrast ratio of 4.5:1 was chosen for level AA because it
compensated for the loss in contrast sensitivity usually experienced by
users with vision loss equivalent to approximately 20/40 vision. (20/40
calculates to approximately 4.5:1.) 20/40 is commonly reported as
typical visual acuity of elders at roughly age 80.
\[[GITTINGS-FOZARD](#GITTINGS-FOZARD)\]

The contrast ratio of 7:1 was chosen for level AAA because it
compensated for the loss in contrast sensitivity usually experienced by
users with vision loss equivalent to approximately 20/80 vision. People
with more than this degree of vision loss usually use assistive
technologies to access their content (and the assistive technologies
usually have contrast enhancing, as well as magnification capability
built into them). The 7:1 level therefore generally provides
compensation for the loss in contrast sensitivity experienced by users
with low vision who do not use assistive technology and provides
contrast enhancement for color deficiency as well.

Calculations in \[[ISO-9241-3](#ISO-9241-3)\] and
\[[ANSI-HFES-100-1988](#ANSI-HFES-100-1988)\] are for body text. A
relaxed contrast ratio is provided for text that is much larger.

### Notes on formula

Conversion from nonlinear to linear RGB values is based on IEC/4WD
61966-2-1 \[[IEC-4WD](#IEC-4WD)\].

The formula (`L1/L2`) for contrast is based on
\[[ISO-9241-3](#ISO-9241-3)\] and
\[[ANSI-HFES-100-1988](#ANSI-HFES-100-1988)\] standards.

The ANSI/HFS 100-1988 standard calls for the contribution from ambient
light to be included in the calculation of L1 and L2. The `.05` value
used is based on Typical Viewing Flare from \[[IEC-4WD](#IEC-4WD)\].

This success criterion and its definitions use the terms "contrast
ratio" and "relative luminance" rather than "luminance" to reflect the
fact that web content does not emit light itself. The contrast ratio
gives a measure of the relative luminance that would result when
displayed. (Because it is a ratio, it is dimensionless.)

<div class="note">

### Inactive User Interface Components

User Interface Components that are not available for user interaction
(e.g., a disabled control in HTML) are not required to meet contrast
requirements. An inactive user interface component is visible but not
currently operable. An example would be a submit button at the bottom of
a form that is visible but cannot be activated until all the required
fields in the form are completed.

## Benefits

- People with low vision often have difficulty reading text that does
  not contrast with its background. This can be exacerbated if the
  person has a color vision deficiency that lowers the contrast even
  further. Providing a minimum luminance contrast ratio between the text
  and its background can make the text more readable even if the person
  does not see the full range of colors. It also works for the rare
  individuals who see no color.

## Key Terms

assistive technology  
hardware and/or software that acts as a [user agent](#dfn-user-agent),
or along with a mainstream user agent, to provide functionality to meet
the requirements of users with disabilities that go beyond those offered
by mainstream user agents

<div class="note">

Note 1

functionality provided by assistive technology includes alternative
presentations (e.g., as synthesized speech or magnified content),
alternative input methods (e.g., voice), additional navigation or
orientation mechanisms, and content transformations (e.g., to make
tables more accessible).

</div>

<div class="note">

Note 2

Assistive technologies often communicate data and messages with
mainstream user agents by using and monitoring APIs.

</div>

<div class="note">

Note 3

The distinction between mainstream user agents and assistive
technologies is not absolute. Many mainstream user agents provide some
features to assist individuals with disabilities. The basic difference
is that mainstream user agents target broad and diverse audiences that
usually include people with and without disabilities. Assistive
technologies target narrowly defined populations of users with specific
disabilities. The assistance provided by an assistive technology is more
specific and appropriate to the needs of its target users. The
mainstream user agent may provide important functionality to assistive
technologies like retrieving web content from program objects or parsing
markup into identifiable bundles.

</div>

Example

Assistive technologies that are important in the context of this
document include the following:

- screen magnifiers, and other visual reading assistants, which are used
  by people with visual, perceptual and physical print disabilities to
  change text font, size, spacing, color, synchronization with speech,
  etc. in order to improve the visual readability of rendered text and
  images;
- screen readers, which are used by people who are blind to read textual
  information through synthesized speech or braille;
- text-to-speech software, which is used by some people with cognitive,
  language, and learning disabilities to convert text into synthetic
  speech;
- speech recognition software, which may be used by people who have some
  physical disabilities;
- alternative keyboards, which are used by people with certain physical
  disabilities to simulate the keyboard (including alternate keyboards
  that use head pointers, single switches, sip/puff and other special
  input devices.);
- alternative pointing devices, which are used by people with certain
  physical disabilities to simulate mouse pointing and button
  activations.

contrast ratio  
(L1 + 0.05) / (L2 + 0.05), where

- L1 is the [relative luminance](#dfn-relative-luminance) of the lighter
  of the colors, and
- L2 is the [relative luminance](#dfn-relative-luminance) of the darker
  of the colors.

<div class="note">

Note 1

Contrast ratios can range from 1 to 21 (commonly written 1:1 to 21:1).

</div>

<div class="note">

Note 2

Because authors do not have control over user settings as to how text is
rendered (for example font smoothing or anti-aliasing), the contrast
ratio for text can be evaluated with anti-aliasing turned off.

</div>

<div class="note">

Note 3

For the purpose of Success Criteria 1.4.3 and 1.4.6, contrast is
measured with respect to the specified background over which the text is
rendered in normal usage. If no background color is specified, then
white is assumed.

</div>

<div class="note">

Note 4

Background color is the specified color of content over which the text
is to be rendered in normal usage. It is a failure if no background
color is specified when the text color is specified, because the user's
default background color is unknown and cannot be evaluated for
sufficient contrast. For the same reason, it is a failure if no text
color is specified when a background color is specified.

</div>

<div class="note">

Note 5

When there is a border around the letter, the border can add contrast
and would be used in calculating the contrast between the letter and its
background. A narrow border around the letter would be used as the
letter. A wide border around the letter that fills in the inner details
of the letters acts as a halo and would be considered background.

</div>

<div class="note">

Note 6

WCAG conformance should be evaluated for color pairs specified in the
content that an author would expect to appear adjacent in typical
presentation. Authors need not consider unusual presentations, such as
color changes made by the user agent, except where caused by authors'
code.

</div>

human language  
language that is spoken, written or signed (through visual or tactile
means) to communicate with humans

<div class="note">

Note

See also [sign language](#dfn-sign-language).

</div>

image of text  
text that has been rendered in a non-text form (e.g., an image) in order
to achieve a particular visual effect

<div class="note">

Note

This does not include text that is part of a picture that contains
significant other visual content.

</div>

Example

A person's name on a nametag in a photograph.

large scale  
with at least 18 point or 14 point bold or font size that would yield
equivalent size for Chinese, Japanese and Korean (CJK) fonts

<div class="note">

Note 1

Fonts with extraordinarily thin strokes or unusual features and
characteristics that reduce the familiarity of their letter forms are
harder to read, especially at lower contrast levels.

</div>

<div class="note">

Note 2

Font size is the size when the content is delivered. It does not include
resizing that may be done by a user.

</div>

<div class="note">

Note 3

The actual size of the character that a user sees is dependent both on
the author-defined size and the user's display or user agent settings.
For many mainstream body text fonts, 14 and 18 point is roughly
equivalent to 1.2 and 1.5 em or to 120% or 150% of the default size for
body text (assuming that the body font is 100%), but authors would need
to check this for the particular fonts in use. When fonts are defined in
relative units, the actual point size is calculated by the user agent
for display. The point size should be obtained from the user agent, or
calculated based on font metrics as the user agent does, when evaluating
this success criterion. Users who have low vision would be responsible
for choosing appropriate settings.

</div>

<div class="note">

Note 4

When using text without specifying the font size, the smallest font size
used on major browsers for unspecified text would be a reasonable size
to assume for the font. If a level 1 heading is rendered in 14pt bold or
higher on major browsers, then it would be reasonable to assume it is
large text. Relative scaling can be calculated from the default sizes in
a similar fashion.

</div>

<div class="note">

Note 5

The 18 and 14 point sizes for roman texts are taken from the minimum
size for large print (14pt) and the larger standard font size (18pt).
For other fonts such as CJK languages, the "equivalent" sizes would be
the minimum large print size used for those languages and the next
larger standard large print size.

</div>

programmatically determined  
determined by software from author-supplied data provided in a way that
different [user agents](#dfn-user-agent), including [assistive
technologies](#dfn-assistive-technology), can extract and present this
information to users in different modalities

Example 1

Determined in a markup language from elements and attributes that are
accessed directly by commonly available assistive technology.

Example 2

Determined from technology-specific data structures in a non-markup
language and exposed to assistive technology via an accessibility API
that is supported by commonly available assistive technology.

pure decoration  
serving only an aesthetic purpose, providing no information, and having
no functionality

<div class="note">

Note

Text is only purely decorative if the words can be rearranged or
substituted without changing their purpose.

</div>

Example

The cover page of a dictionary has random words in very light text in
the background.

relative luminance  
the relative brightness of any point in a colorspace, normalized to 0
for darkest black and 1 for lightest white

<div class="note">

Note 1

<div>

For the sRGB colorspace, the relative luminance of a color is defined as
L = 0.2126 \* **R** + 0.7152 \* **G** + 0.0722 \* **B** where **R**,
**G** and **B** are defined as:

- if RsRGB \<= 0.04045 then **R** = RsRGB/12.92 else **R** =
  ((RsRGB+0.055)/1.055) ^ 2.4
- if GsRGB \<= 0.04045 then **G** = GsRGB/12.92 else **G** =
  ((GsRGB+0.055)/1.055) ^ 2.4
- if BsRGB \<= 0.04045 then **B** = BsRGB/12.92 else **B** =
  ((BsRGB+0.055)/1.055) ^ 2.4

and RsRGB, GsRGB, and BsRGB are defined as:

- RsRGB = R8bit/255
- GsRGB = G8bit/255
- BsRGB = B8bit/255

The "^" character is the exponentiation operator. (Formula taken from
\[[SRGB](https://webstore.iec.ch/publication/6169)\].)

</div>

</div>

<div class="note">

Note 2

Before May 2021 the value of 0.04045 in the definition was different
(0.03928). It was taken from an older version of the specification and
has been updated. It has no practical effect on the calculations in the
context of these guidelines.

</div>

<div class="note">

Note 3

Almost all systems used today to view web content assume sRGB encoding.
Unless it is known that another color space will be used to process and
display the content, authors should evaluate using sRGB colorspace. If
using other color spaces, see [Understanding Success Criterion
1.4.3](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/contrast-minimum).

</div>

<div class="note">

Note 4

If dithering occurs after delivery, then the source color value is used.
For colors that are dithered at the source, the average values of the
colors that are dithered should be used (average R, average G, and
average B).

</div>

<div class="note">

Note 5

Tools are available that automatically do the calculations when testing
contrast and flash.

</div>

<div class="note">

Note 6

A [separate page giving the relative luminance definition using
MathML](relative-luminance.html) to display the formulas is available.

</div>

sign language  
a language using combinations of movements of the hands and arms, facial
expressions, or body positions to convey meaning

text  
sequence of characters that can be [programmatically
determined](#dfn-programmatically-determined), where the sequence is
expressing something in [human language](#dfn-human-language)

user agent  
any software that retrieves and presents web content for users

Example

Web browsers, media players, plug-ins, and other programs — including
[assistive technologies](#dfn-assistive-technology) — that help in
retrieving, rendering, and interacting with web content.

user interface component  
a part of the content that is perceived by users as a single control for
a distinct function

<div class="note">

Note 1

Multiple user interface components may be implemented as a single
programmatic element. "Components" here is not tied to programming
techniques, but rather to what the user perceives as separate controls.

</div>

<div class="note">

Note 2

User interface components include form elements and links as well as
components generated by scripts.

</div>

<div class="note">

Note 3

What is meant by "component" or "user interface component" here is also
sometimes called "user interface element".

</div>

Example

An applet has a "control" that can be used to move through content by
line or page or random access. Since each of these would need to have a
name and be settable independently, they would each be a "user interface
component."
